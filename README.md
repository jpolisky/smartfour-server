# Smart Four Website
This is the server side of my smart four website which I've uploaded to GitHub so it can be hosted through Render at https://smartfour-server.onrender.com/
I made it public in case anybody is curious about how the backend functions and that will really just be me forgetting in a few days how everything works
More information is on the client-side version of this repo which is "smart-four" which I recommend checking out too ðŸ˜º
